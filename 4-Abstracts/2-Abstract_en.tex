    This master's thesis introduces a novel solution for the fusion of camera and radar sensors, 
    aimed at enhancing the robustness and accuracy of object tracking in diverse and challenging scenarios. 
    The proposed solution employs a method for correlating data from these heterogeneous sensors 
    and integrates them seamlessly using the Extended Kalman Filter framework. 
    The resulting algorithm demonstrates the capability to precisely track and identify multiple objects, 
    even in complex and dynamically changing environments, all while achieving real-time performance.
    By utilizing width and height information in pixels from the camera,
     the algorithm generates real-world 3D bounding boxes using radar data. 
    This research offers a valuable contribution to the field of sensor fusion, providing a reliable 
    and efficient means of addressing the demands of modern applications such as autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and robotics.
