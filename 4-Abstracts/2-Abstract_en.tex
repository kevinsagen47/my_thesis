    This master's thesis introduces a solution for the fusion of camera and radar sensors, 
    aimed at enhancing the robustness and accuracy of object tracking in diverse and challenging scenarios. 
    The proposed solution employs a method for correlating data from these heterogeneous sensors 
    and integrates them seamlessly using the Bayesian Fusion and Extended Kalman Filter framework. 
    The resulting algorithm demonstrates the capability to precisely track and identify multiple objects, 
    even in complex and dynamically changing environments, all while achieving real-time performance.
    By utilizing width and height information in pixels from the camera,
     the algorithm generates real-world 3D bounding boxes by fusing with radar information.
    The proposed fusion method managed to achieve a range accuracy result of RMSE 0.1561 m and an angle accuracy of 0.0520 rad.
