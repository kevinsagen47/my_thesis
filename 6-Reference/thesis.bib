abstract="Self-driving cars are the next milestone of the automation industry. To achieve the level of autonomy expected in a self-driving car, the vehicle needs to be mounted with an assortment of sensors that can help the vehicle to perceive its 3D environment better which leads to better decision making and control of the vehicle. To complement the advantages of different sensors, sensor fusion is done, to enhance the accuracy of the overall information. In real-time implementations, uncertainty in factors that affect the vehicle's motion can lead to overshoot in parameters. To avoid that, an estimation filter is used to predict and update the fused values. This paper focuses on sensor fusion of Lidar and Camera followed by estimation using Kalman filter. It can be seen how the use of an estimation filter can significantly improve the accuracy in tracking the path of an obstacle.",

New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modification to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite-memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the co-efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.}",
