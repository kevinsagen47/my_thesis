\section{Research Background and Motivation}\label{sec:1-motivation}
The inspiration for this thesis arose during the author's involvement with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). 
At the time, it was evident that existing obstacle-tracking and avoidance methods for UAVs faced significant challenges. 
The solutions in use were either incredibly unreliable or prohibitively expensive.
For instance, cameras proved to be excellent for object tracking but struggled when it came to avoiding obstacles due to their limited range perception capabilities.
Conversely, LiDAR excelled at obstacle detection, yet its reliability suffered in adverse weather conditions, and the associated costs could be exorbitant. 
Radar, while promising, also had its limitations, characterized by sparse and noisy data, 
making the identification and tracking of objects a formidable task, as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:trade_off_and_plane}\subref{subfig:trade_off_sub}.

The concept of fusing radar and camera technologies emerged as a promising approach.
In theory, this fusion could provide accurate object tracking while maintaining the capability to avoid obstacles with great range accuracy. 
Nevertheless, this approach presents several challenges. 
Notably, radar and camera data exist in different planes, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:trade_off_and_plane}\subref{subfig:cam_radar_sub}.
This thesis shall explore a solution that can effectively process the raw data from both sensors 
and fuse them to create an ultimate sensor, applicable across a wide spectrum of use cases

\section{Related Work\small(to be done)}\label{sec:1-related_work}
In recent years, there have been growing trends of lidar-radar fusion and lidar-camera fusion in academia.
However, there is little to no attention to radar-camera fusion research.

\section{Contribution}\label{sec:1-contribution}


In this thesis, our primary objective is to harness the strengths of camera and radar sensors, 
while simultaneously mitigating their inherent limitations. To achieve this, several notable contributions have been made:

1. \textbf{Development of a Novel Multimodal Kalman Filter Model: }
We introduce an innovative framework that leverages a multimodal Kalman Filter model. 
This model enables the fusion of data from both camera and radar sensors, 
facilitating more accurate and robust object tracking and identification. 
By combining the temporal and spatial data characteristics of these sensors, 
our approach enhances tracking precision and minimizes errors.

2. \textbf{Correlation of Radar and Image Detection Data: }
A critical aspect of our work is the introduction of a method to correlate radar and image detection results. 
This correlation process is essential for establishing a seamless connection between the two sensor modalities.
By correlating the data effectively, we improve the accuracy of object tracking and further refine the quality of fused information.

3. \textbf{Utilization of Bayesian Fusion for Noise Reduction: }
We employ Bayesian fusion techniques to reduce noise in the fused data.
This step not only enhances the overall data quality but also significantly improves the reliability of the output. 

4. \textbf{Versatility in Challenging Scenarios: }
The contribution of this thesis is highlighted by the algorithm's comprehensive testing across various conditions, 
with a specific focus on addressing the challenging "blind spot" scenarios. 
The research demonstrates instances where sensor fusion complements the capabilities of individual sensors, 
which will be further explored in this thesis.


In summary, this thesis offers a significant contribution to the field of sensor fusion by introducing a comprehensive solution 
that harnesses the advantages of camera and radar sensors while addressing their respective limitations.
 The proposed multimodal Kalman Filter model, correlation methods, and Bayesian fusion techniques collectively form 
 a powerful framework that enhances object tracking, reduces noise, and enables the system to excel in scenarios that were previously challenging for individual sensors.
