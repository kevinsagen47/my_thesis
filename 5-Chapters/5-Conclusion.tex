\section{Limitation and Future Work}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Image-to-radar mapping assumes that both sensors are perfectly parallel.
    \item The algorithm assumes the object's centroid point is the average point of radar cluster.
    \item Radar point reflection intensity is not taken into consideration.
    \item Radar elevation is not utilized due to its sparse resolution and noisy measurement.
    \item Ground truth is not truly accurate since the objects tracked are humans.
\end{enumerate}
