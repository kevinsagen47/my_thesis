\section{Limitation and Future Work}
In the future, addressing certain aspects could enhance the thesis's outcomes. 
%For instance, exploring methods that account for potential misalignment between sensors would refine the image-to-radar mapping. 
For instance, exploring methods that account for width data from radar clusters to improve width accuracy. 
Introducing algorithms considering radar point reflection intensity might augment accuracy. 
Additionally, devising strategies to leverage radar elevation, 
despite its sparse and noisy nature, could improve overall performance. 
Further validation considering the limitations of ground truth, 
particularly for human-tracked objects, would strengthen the thesis's findings.
